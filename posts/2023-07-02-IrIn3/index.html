    <h1>New article in <i>Inorganic Chemistry</i> - The 18-<i>n</i>+<i>m</i> Isomerism of IrIn<sub>3</sub></h1>
    <p class="container-info">Jul 02, 2023</p>
    <p>My paper on the polymorphism of IrIn<sub>3</sub> was published recently in <em>Inorganic Chemistry</em>. Check out <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01496">&quot;Entropic Control of Bonding, Guided by Chemical Pressure: Phase Transitions and 18-<em>n</em>+<em>m</em> Isomerism of IrIn<sub>3</sub>&quot;</a>. This paper carries on the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.9b10473"><em>Frustrated and Allowed Structural Transitions (FAST)</em></a> concept, in which structural relationships investigated from an electronic and atomic packing perspective. In my <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c03393">previous article</a> about a series of superstructures in the <em>RE</em>Al<sub>3</sub> system, the electronic and atomic packing are in conflict. In this case, atomic packing prevails, and ultimately shapes the electronics of both the high and low temperature polymorphs.</p>

<p>The most fascinating part of the story was the unexpected introduction of vibrational entropy. In hindsight, it makes a lot of sense, however, when I first began on this project, I was focused on seeking out a story similar to <em>RE</em>Al<sub>3</sub>. It took me quite a while (and a lot of headscratching) before I noticed the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00917">chemical pressure quadrupoles</a> that made me even consider pursuing phonon calculations. These were not trivial calculations (cluster interruptions and user errors prolonged these months-long calculations even longer), but it was gratifying to tie these concepts into something tangible and close to literature: the phase transition temperature.</p>
<p>Overall, this project was a bit of a ride. I'm excited about the work we did, and the future work we could do with phonons. Who knows what's next!</p>
